# Employee-Burnout-Prediction-Analysis.# Employee Burnout Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict employee burnout using machine learning models, enabling early intervention through proactive measures. By analyzing various data points such as workload, work hours, and stress indicators, the system identifies potential burnout risks and provides real-time insights for timely actions.
## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing from multiple employee activity sources.
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models to predict burnout.
- Deployment of the best-performing models to monitor employee well-being.
- Real-time dashboard for insights and alerts.
- Proactive intervention strategies based on predictive results.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-burnout-prediction.git
   
2. Install required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   
   python preprocess_data.py
   
4. Train the models:
   
   python train_models.py
   
5. Deploy and monitor the models:
